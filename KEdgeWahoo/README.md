K-Edge Wahoo holder
===================
The KEdge is a Holder made from alloy. However, its Sigma version is better available and cheaper - so this Thing turns a Sigma version into a Wahoo version by replacing the holder. 

Red and thin things are the original parts. 

This thing consists of 3 parts: 

 - Base ring - this gives the snap layer a place to wipe out to when the Wahoo is twisted in
 - Snap layer - this has a spring that snaps into the nodges of the wahoo base
 - Twist in layer - this has a through whole for the socket, twist it until it snaps in.
 
 To replace the original you need a tiny torx screwdriver. The Base and Snap layer are just stuck on these tiny screws, the screws will have to be gently forced into the Twist in layer.
